# ‚ú® Features:

‚úîÔ∏è Advanced Leg Configuration ‚Äì Customize leg segments with precise control over bones lengths and positions allowing for configurable legs structures.

### Example of legs structures:

‚úîÔ∏è Customizable Leg Behavior ‚Äì Define leg behavior with parameters like rest distance, extension speed, and rotation amplitude, 
path followed by the foot while returning to the leg's base position tailoring movements to specific needs.

‚úîÔ∏è Dynamic Ground Adaptation ‚Äì The body and the legs adapts to the ground's angle and height at a configurable speed, ensuring smooth and realistic motion over uneven terrain.

‚úîÔ∏è Second Order Controllers ‚Äì Integrate second-order systems for both movement and rotation, providing fine-tuned control over animation dynamics.

‚úîÔ∏è Real-Time Simulation ‚Äì Activate walk cycle simulations with adjustable targets and rotation angles, enabling real-time testing and iteration of animations.

‚úîÔ∏è Example Scenes ‚Äì Includes example scenes to help you get started quickly and understand the addon's capabilities.

# üì¶ Installation:

**This addon needs the SecondOrderDynamics to work.**

1. **Download the Addon:** Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. **Move the Folder:** Place the ProceduralAnimation folder inside your "res://addons/" directory.
3. **Enable the Plugin:**

    Open Godot Editor.
   
    Go to Project > Project Settings > Plugins.
   
    Enable ProceduralAnimation Addon.

**Note:** You only need to place the ProceduralAnimation folder in "res://addons/" in your godot app.
4. Repeat the same steps for the SecondOrderDynamics addon (also present on my github account).


# üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide:
To utilize the Procedural Animation Addon, follow these steps to set up your character with procedural movements:

1. **Character Setup:**
   - Start with a `CharacterBody3D` node. This will serve as the base for your character.

2. **Attach Leg Nodes:**
   - Add four `ThreeSegmentLeg` nodes to your `CharacterBody3D`. Ensure you are using `ThreeSegmentLeg` and not `ThreeSegmentLegClass`, which is an internal class used by the plugin.
   - Position the four `ThreeSegmentLeg` nodes at the corners of your `CharacterBody3D`.

3. **Add Controller:**
   - Add a `RadialQuadripedController` node as a sibling to your `CharacterBody3D` (i.e., under the same parent node).

4. **Configure the Controller:**
   - In the `RadialQuadripedController`, specify the corresponding node for each leg and the body.
   - Customize the behavior settings within the controller to match your desired animation dynamics.

5. **Movement and Rotation:**
   - To move or rotate the `CharacterBody3D` in the editor, manipulate the `RadialQuadripedController`. Your character will follow the controller's movements.
   - Note: For movements along the Z-axis, directly adjust the `CharacterBody3D` node.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the Procedural Animation Addon into your Godot project, enabling dynamic and customizable procedural movements for your character.
